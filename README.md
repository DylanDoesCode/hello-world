# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Dylan,
I'm currently enrolled in computer technology with a coding path at my local community college. delving into the world of programming this year has been fascinating. Reformed videogame addict (mostly), I'll read any epic fantasy book series,I love too many music and visual artists to name here. I plan to jump into a Python boot camp during summer vacation 2020.
  Seeking a career in front end web development initially, Would like to seee where my skills can take me.
  I aspire to be a part of a development team that has a positive impact on a large scale of users, that would be awesome!
  Thanks for taking the time to "README" Happy Coding</end>
